 1️⃣ Connect to your local Postgres
Since you set up Postgres locally with user postgres and password MyNewSecurePassword123, you can connect using psql.

Open your admin Command Prompt and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
psql -U postgres
then enter the password:

nginx
Copy
Edit
MyNewSecurePassword123
✅ That should drop you at the postgres=# prompt.

🟢 2️⃣ Switch to your app’s database
If you created a local database with the same name as production (smartai_db_2819), switch to it:

sql
Copy
Edit
\c smartai_db_2819
If you never made that database locally, you’ll stay on the default postgres database.

🟢 3️⃣ Describe the users table
To check the table structure, run:

sql
Copy
Edit
\d users
✅ This will list all columns, including whether a password column exists.

🟢 4️⃣ View user rows
You can see the actual contents of the table:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 5;
✅ That will help confirm if there is any user with a NULL password or missing data.
